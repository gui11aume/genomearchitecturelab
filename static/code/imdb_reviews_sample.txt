It isn't close to his best work. While stylishly directed (to be expected being Bava) and with plenty of atmosphere, it is low on both suspense and gore, and sets up a potentially dynamite premise (the resurrection of an evil Vlad The Impaler-like maniac hell bent on revenge), then goes nowhere much with it. One or two sequences are outstanding, but overall it's a major disappointment, and the usually excellent Joseph Cotton (who did some strong genre work in movies like 'The Abominable Dr Phibes' and 'Soylent Green') is a bit of a let down in the title role. Even so, no Mario Bava movie can be dismissed entirely, and for all its flaws it's still worth watching more than almost all of Hollywood's recent puerile and uninspired horror output.</p></div>

Seems the Baron was a bit of a sadist, just in case the &quot;Baron Blood&quot; title didn't give it away already. Our young hero, Peter, meets Elke Sommer, and instead of breaking into the castles dungeon in the middle of the night and having sex like any normal hot young couple in the early 70s,<br><br>these two brilliantly decide instead to perform a centuries old ritual designed to raise the dead. When will these people learn? The Baron rises, seen first as a Phantom-of-the-Opera type guy with a face like a spoiled casserole, and later as a wheelchair bound and Maybelline dependent Joseph Cotton.<br><br>This really isn't a bad little film. There's some great spooky lighting techniques, some even better funky music and some gorgeous shots of the European<br><br>countryside. The ancient, crumbling castle is a wonderful set and the death<br><br>scenes are quite gruesome, especially the one featuring an Iron Maiden-ish<br><br>casket and a guy who looks a LOT like the late great Peter Lorre. In a nice twist, there's even a centuries-dead witch who turns out to be the GOOD guy! (Or girl, as the case may be) The acting isn't that great, but it doesn't make this an unwatchable film by any means. The story seems loosely based on the life of<br><br>Vlad the Impaler, but still manages to be original and interesting. A nice feeling of dread permeates the entire film. One of Bava's best efforts.</p></div>

The man just made nothing but masterpieces and cult-highlights! Perhaps not the most genius film to state Bava's importance, Baron Blood still remains a stylish gothic wholesome that destroys practically all American horror movies. Baron Blood contains a lot of suspense and a rather fair amount of gore and maniacal slaughters. Other than that, all the usual Bava characteristics are present such as beautiful music, breath-taking locations and top-scenery (Von Kleist's torture chamber!!!). I just love the basic plot of Baron Blood! The key figure is a bloodthirsty madman, who was cursed to suffer eternally in hell back in the 17th century. A direct ascendant of his found a parchment, containing a formula to bring him back. Driven by curiosity he and a female architecture student (Elke Sommer &#150; who already worked with Bava in the sublime &#145;Lisa and the Devil') speak the words and true terror is resurrected once more. Innocent inhabitants of the small Austrian town start to die in horrible ways again. Meanwhile, a mysterious and lonely millionaire comes to town and buys the Baron's castle&#133; Could there be a relation between the dwelling maniac and this man?<br><br>There are some serious plot holes in Baron Blood &#150; almost the size of a melon - and the acting performances in this film surely are below standards. The constant screaming of Elke Sommer might become annoying after a while and especially Joseph Cotton disappoints with his uninspired performance. Cotton is best known for his role as Vincent Price's opponent in `The Abominable Dr. Phibes'. In spite of these few negative aspects, Baron Blood still is a MUST for Italian horror lovers and fans of horror cinema in general. If it were only for the haunting sequence in which Elke Sommer is being chased through the dark and foggy small streets of the village. Like none other, this scene proves that Bava is a master in creating a claustrophobic atmosphere.</p></div>

Combined, they create the perfect horror movie atmosphere. Unfortunately, another Bava trademark is here as well - a weak script.

After having been brought back to life, he continues the murderous ways of the past. There are some truly frightening moments in the film. (I'm not talking just creepy, I mean downright scary.)

So evocative of that period is this film that it takes not even a moment&#x27;s thought to mentally recast Boris Karloff as the Baron, Nan Grey as his intended victim and to tune away the vivid Technicolor into haunting black and white.<br><br>As in FRANKENSTIEN or THE MUMMY, the evil in the film is unwittingly unleashed upon the world by the film&#x27;s hero. In this case it is American Peter Kleist, who returns to the German castle of his ancestor Baron Otto Von Kleist. Even though he is aware that his ancestor, nicknamed &#x22;Baron Blood&#x22; was a sadistic monster who butchered and tortured the people of the countryside, Peter foolishly recites an ancient spell capable of resurrecting the Baron. The restored Von Kleist immediately resumes his homicidal ways, and now Peter, assisted by the beautiful Elke Sommer as a local historian, must find a way to undo what he has thoughtlessly wrought.<br><br>In the classic horror films of the 1930&#x27;s the monsters were iconic and unforgettable, while the heroes were bland and almost entirely irrelevant. After all, who remembers who played the &#x22;hero&#x22; opposite Lugosi in Dracula or Karloff in THE MUMMY? (For trivia&#x27;s sake it was David Manners in both films.) No, the villain/monster may have spent much of the picture lurking about off screen, or skulking in the shadows, but nevertheless he was always indisputably the star of the show.<br><br>BARON BLOOD maintains this link to its cinematic forbearers. Antonio Cantafora&#x27;s Peter Kleist is satisfactory, but eminently forgettable, while Joseph Cotton, obviously having a ball, is terrific in his villainous role. Cotton&#x27;s performance as the resurrected Von Kleist is spot on perfect, filled with evil charm and malevolent glee. He dominates the screen in the best tradition of the movie monsters of old.<br><br>In fact, there is only one significant departure from the classic monster films. Even in the days before the Hayes Commission, blood and gore were rarely seen and usually only suggested in Hollywood motion pictures. BARON BLOOD was produced without such restrictions and, though mild when compared to more recent horror films, it does contain some explicit moments that would have been completely unacceptable in the 1930&#x27;s. Even as a tribute to the grand old days, it must remembered that BARON BLOOD was produced to appeal to a contemporary 1970&#x27;s audience. Bava however realized that things modern will inevitably intrude upon the classic, and made light of this by placing soda pop machines in the halls of the Gothic Von Kleist castle and having prerecorded screams available in the Baron&#x27;s torture chamber at the flip of a switch.<br><br>Not as arty as LISA AND THE DEVIL, not as graphic as BAY OF BLOOD, BARON BLOOD is often unjustly overlooked, or simply dismissed as a minor effort of Mario Bava&#x27;s later period. Such hasty judgments do the film a great disservice. If BARON BLOOD has less of the striking cinematography of Bava&#x27;s best films, it must be argued that such innovation would be out of place in a film striving to recapture the look and atmosphere of the original Hollywood horror movies. If one accepts the movie for what it is, a fine tribute to the genre&#x27;s past, then BARON BLOOD is a great success, both as a homage and as work unto itself.<br><br>BARON BLOOD has been released in numerous VHS and laserdisc editions. The DVD release from Image Entertainment is probably the best example of the film currently available, featuring an uncut 1.85:1 widescreen presentation of the film, complete with the original European musical score, which was replaced when the film was released theatrically in North America.</p></div>

I first saw it on TV when I was 10 years old and got lost in the parts about the witch but don't worry, those parts don't take up much of the film and it gets itself back on track quickly for a really great, cool climax that was truly ahead of it's time. Best of all, it is SCARY! Scenes of the heroine being hunted by the living dead Baron Von Kleist still make me nervous and I must've seen this film 20 times ( I own a VHS and a laserdisc copy of it if that shows how much I enjoy it). Joseph Cotton gives a really fine performance as Mr. Becker, the man who wishes to restore the Baron's castle, and the other main characters are likeable (important if you are to care whether or not they die). Bava is in top form here with some of the best horror film lighting ever done and builds suspense time and again. Don't watch it if you are going to be distracted because you do have to pay attention if you don't want to get lost but if you watch it closely, it's pretty easy to follow. Recent copies of the film are widescreen which is good, but have the original Italian score. The earlier pan and scan tapes are the American International Pictures version which contains a much scarier score by Les Baxter. The widescreen copy is supposedly uncut but I can't tell any difference other than the framing and the score. Either way though, it is a scary, fun horror masterpiece that I always enjoy watching again and again. If you've never seen it before, I dare you to watch it alone late at night.</p></div>

With the possible exception of Barbara Steele in Black Sunday, Bava's films are noted mostly for Bava's direction and Baron Blood is no exception. The acting in the film is competent, but what makes this a great horror film is the visual landscapes Bava paints for us, whether it is a sadistic caped killer rampaging the tiny streets of a dark European night filled with fog or the stately grandeur of the animated dead within the confines of the castle, Bava is an artist using colours like a Rembrandt or Picasso. Baron Blood is a gruesome film filled with genuine terror and it will scare because it is scary in both content and with its heavy mood looming throughout.</p></div>

As usual, Bava seems dismissive of things like story, character and acting, and concentrates on creating a memorable mise-en-scene, which makes a lot of the juxtaposition of the old and the contemporary: an ancient castle with a Coke machine, Elke Sommer in a miniskirt running through old fog-shrouded streets, etc.<br><br>Immediately after Baron Blood, Bava filmed what I consider his masterpiece, Lisa and the Devil (also with Sommer) which was sacrificed by its producers to splice with new footage for an Exorcist ripoff called House of Exorcism. Baron Blood fared much better, suffering only from being rescored and cut by eight minutes. If you want to know where Dario Argento learned his tricks, look at Bava.</p></div>

He is welcomed in the airport by his uncle Dr. Karl Hummel (Massimo Girotti) and he asks if he could visit the castle of his ancestor, the evil Baron Otto von Kleist a.k.a. Baron Blood. In the Sixteenth Century, the sadistic baron was cursed by a witch Elisabeth Holle that he had burned at the stake and then he was killed by the locals in his Castle of Death. Peter meets the gorgeous Eva Arnold (Elke Sommer) that works restoring the castle and invites her to go with him to the castle after dinner to read an incantation written in an ancient parchment that would evoke the family course and bring the Baron back to life. After reading the magic words, the wind blows the parchment to the fireplace and it burns. When villagers mysterious disappear and Eva is chased by a weird man, they realize that they have released the Baron and they do not have the parchment anymore to call the incantation off. Their hope is that the clairvoyant and medium Christina Hoffmann (Rada Rassimov), who is a descendant of Elisabeth, might help them.<br><br>&#x22;Baron Blood&#x22; is another eerie and spooky movie of Mario Bava. The uncanny story of curse, witchcraft and resurrection is very well supported by the predictable screenplay that works well, but the stylish cinematography, the lighting and shadows and the camera work with unusual angle are impressive and give a creepy and nightmarish atmosphere to the feature. This is the first time that I see this movie and the IMDb Rating is underrated; I believe fans of horror movies will really like &#x22;Baron Blood&#x22;. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available</p></div>
