<p>Sorry, this imdb.com (Internet Movie Database) page is not
accessible from your address or browser. This page contains
information which may explain why you are seeing this error instead of
the page you wanted. Please read this information and if <b>after</b>
reading it you still do not understand why you have been denied access
then you should use the contact details at the end to request
information specific to your case.</p>
<p>Note: the majority of people seeing this page are <b>innocent</b>
users suffering because of offenders who use the same Internet address
or software as they do. Chances are, you're not the offender and we'll
do our best to restore your access once we're aware of your
circumstances.</p>
<hr width="30%">
<p>The three main reasons for seeing this message are:</p>
<ol>
<li>your browser or proxy server isn't identifying itself and is
blocked because we don't trust it to behave.
<blockquote>
<p>If your browser/proxy/agent does not send a HTTP <b>User-Agent</b>
header, this server will reject the request. Most anonymous software
turns out to be automated junk that hits us too fast and too
hard. This deprives our online users of a quick and speedy service.
Such denials of service (intentional or not) will result in loss of
access to our site.  
You may be able to gain access by reading the 
<span style="background: #FFFF00;"><b>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/Errors/empty_UA">information here</a></b></span>
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>you've typed or followed some broken URL.
<blockquote>
<p>Returning to the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">home page</a> should get you started.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>your Internet address or web browser or proxy server has been
banned for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/terms">misuse of our service</a>,
e.g. <b>overloading</b> our servers with automated requests that are
just <b>too fast</b>
<blockquote>
<P>If you want 
<b>your own local copy of the database</b> then you only needed to
have looked for it.  
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/interfaces">http://imdb.com/interfaces</a> will
explain how you can have your own copy of the IMDb and as it runs on
your system you can hit it as hard and as frequently as you like.
Please note the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Copyright">copyright</a> on the data.
</p>
<p>All requests from NetSonic, NetJet, NetCarta, Autonomy, WebWhacker,
FlashSite, Java102, Teleport-Pro, MemoWeb, Microsoft's
MS-Catapult/0.9, Netscape's Catalog-Robot, Microsoft's "Site Analyst"
are rejected because of persistent attempts to download huge numbers
of pages as fast as the networks permit.</p>
<p>So called 'web-accelerators' can be a nuisance and we don't want
them here. We can't block these programs but what we can do is send
this page instead of whatever the software asked for every
time. Please disable your URL prefetching 'web accelerators' to avoid
loss of service.</p>
<p>Personal web crawlers (e.g. the built-in crawler modes from MSIE
4.0 and Netscape 4.0) are not welcome on this site. MSIE 4.0 is more
responsible in that it sometimes identifies itself differently when in
crawler mode, so we can block crawling with it, Netscape 4.0 doesn't
identify itself as being in crawler mode so we can't detect it -
instead we have to use more extreme measures to block abusers of our
service - IP addresses of these abusers can be blocked completely once
they misbehave (note that Netscape and Microsoft's Internet Explorer
are <b>not</b> blocked.)</p>
<p>Filtering IMDb isn't allowed, so WebWasher filters etc aren't
allowed. If everyone used a banner ad filter the vast majority of
sites would run out of money to provide you with 'free'
services... it's either banner ads or subscription fees.</p>
